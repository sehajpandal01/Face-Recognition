# Face-Recognition
A Program that uses data sets to go through multiple levels of face recognition using Tensorflow

Current Progress: Needs more data for multiple different people in terms of recogniton software, currently have athletes just as a way to test and debug.

Possible Applications: Straying from the traditional Face ID applications, and maybe using it for a different purpose, like possibly skin clarity to help more in the self-care industry. 

Requirements for installation:
pip install tensorflow
pip install opencv-python
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
